> In heavy development, don't expect ANYTHING to work.

A web-based digital media workstation that cares, made by a human.

## Target feature list
[Full list here](https://github.com/yuckdevchan/timecrash/blob/main/bugs.md)
- Digital audio, MIDI and (basic) video editing
- Physical and software instrument workflow support
- A well designed, intuitive, fast and frictionless user experience
- Media encoding and analysis workflow features
  - Converting formats using [ffmpeg via WASM](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)
- A 'Noodle' playhead option (a playhead that instead of being straight is a curve which noodles through differing snap points in each track)
### Extras
- Live collaborative editing (would require a server)
- Basic image manipulation e.g. cropping etc.
- Advanced audio effects e.g. cleanup background noise
- Advanced video effects e.g. chroma key, transformations
- Colour grading workflow
