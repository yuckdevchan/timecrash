- [ ] media pool content gets bunched up when resizing it
- [ ] playhead arrow shouldn't be a triangle, but a triangle with it's straight side extruded upwards, this kind of shape: ⌫, but rotated
- [ ] clip overlap opacity
- [ ] icons in command runner (BLOCKED by lucide bug)
- [ ] timeline tracks are misaligned with their control boxes
- [ ] space to the left of the ruler is empty when it should match the colour of the ruler
- [ ] close button for Window widgets doesn't match close button on Dialog widgets
- [ ] topmost playback controls' hover backgrounds are taller and thinner than the buttons themselves
- [ ] remove animations from lots of controls to make it feel snappier
